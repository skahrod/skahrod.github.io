                <p>I help senior leaders turn product strategy into predictable revenue growth. With over a decade of experience driving technology transformation and building high-performing teams, I've delivered measurable impact including 35x pipeline growth, Â£20M+ investment decisions, and consistently faster time-to-market. My approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on execution, ensuring product decisions drive real business outcomes.</p>
                <p>But results are only part of the story. My real passion is in the way I go about doing things. I care deeply about building cultures where teams thrive and people feel empowered to do their best work. Treating people right and bringing them on the journey means we can get results whilst building strong relationships.</p>
                <p>When not at my desk, you'll find me up a hill with my dogs, in the garage weaving baskets, or pottering around the garden.</p>
