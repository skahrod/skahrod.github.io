                <p class="testimonial-text">"Working with Sandy transformed our approach to product development. She brought invaluable customer insight that had previously been missing and helped us prioritise our roadmap based on real revenue potential. Her ability to engage confidently at all levels of the business, from frontline teams to board members, made her particularly effective in aligning stakeholders and driving momentum. Her direct engagement with customers was exceptional, and both our teams and clients genuinely enjoyed working with her. This approach was instrumental in securing our largest Modern Work deal in years and played a critical role in retaining our biggest customer. Her commercial focus and strategic thinking made all the difference."</p>

Her GTM strategy generated £900K in new pipeline opportunities while helping us achieve product-market fit faster than any of our previous launches. Her understanding of both security requirements and customer buying behaviour was exactly what we needed to break into new markets."</p>

                <p class="testimonial-text">"I’ve been lucky enough to work with Sandy at two different organisations and I’ve seen her successfully tackle everything from product portfolios to marketing campaigns to creating solutions from the ground up. It takes a unique skillset to understand the capabilities and USP of diverse engineering teams and develop these into successful market propositions. It also takes advanced collaboration skills to make the attitudes and mindsets of people all over a business work together - technical or commercial and everything in between. But time and again I’ve seen Sandy accomplish this with incredible leadership skills and empathy. If you’re lucky enough to work on a project with Sandy, she’ll bring her unique skill set and infectious enthusiasm to your team, and she’ll also be the smartest person in the room."</p>
